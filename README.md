Unofficial scripts for installing TCAdmin V2 Panel & MYSql. Works with Ubuntu 18.04.

## Features

- Automatic installation of the TCAdmin V2 Panel (dependencies and database).

## Help and support

For help and support regarding the script itself and **not the official Pterodactyl project**, you can join the [Discord Chat](https://pterodactyl-installer.se/discord).

## Supported installations

List of supported installation setups for panel and Wings (installations supported by this installation script).

### Supported panel operating systems and webservers

| Operating System | Version | nginx support      | PHP Version |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Ubuntu           | 18.04   | :white_check_mark: |             |
|                  | 20.04   | :white_check_mark: |             |

## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the panel, just the daemon or both.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://pterodactyl-installer.se)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._

Here is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8UJhyUFoHM) that illustrates the installation process.

## Firewall setup

The installation scripts can install and configure a firewall for you. The script will ask whether you want this or not. It is highly recommended to opt-in for the automatic firewall setup.
